"Extreme Early Tech Mod for Slow Progression Packs"
# Woodstone

## Description
This mod is meant for slow progression packs where obtaining redstone will be an issue. It provides a mechanism whereby you can begin to have the basic vanilla circuits and machines but at cost of catching or causing fires.

### Technology
* Woodstone because stone is hard to get in early slow mode packs, you can craft four (4) logs together to create woodstone.
* Woodstone Furnace which is made from 8 woodstone in the furnace pattern will produce a woodstone furnace that has a 10% chance to catch fire and if not put out by you the Minecraft mechanics will allow that fire to spread.
* Woodstone Powder is created by placing down woodstone and mining it with a pickaxe. Use it like Redstone dust to make circuits. It has 10% chance to catch fire when a signal is running through it.
* Woodstone Piston is created with woodstone in place of the iron ingot and cobblestone. Woodstone Dust replaces the Redstone Dust and now you have a half-strength piston that has a 10% chance to catch fire.

### Configuration
All of this configurable.

## ModPacks
